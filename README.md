ActiveFrame
===========

A PHP Web Application Framework

To get started:

1. copy all files to a directory (let's say `active_frame`) inside your web server's root document directory.

2. Access the directory from your web browser.  
e.g. `http://localhost/active_frame/`  
OR `http://localhost/active_frame/?path=welcome/`  
OR `http://localhost/active_frame/?path=welcome/index`  
Here `welcome` is the controller name & index is the accessible method of the controller.
You should be able to see the welcome page by now.

3. To connect with database, edit `config/db.config.php` with your own settings.
